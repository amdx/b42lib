# B42 firmware library #

B42 serial protocol implementation for Arduino / PlatformIO.

## Introduction ##

B42 is intended for bi-directional transmission of small command/data frames,
over byte based communication channels (such as serial),
with low latency and frame/protocol error detection.

B42 supports 16 commands with up to 18 bits data payload.

## Documentation ##

For the B42 Protocol Specification, see [docs/B42_protocol.pdf].

Examples are available under:

* [examples/]: for the Arduino IDE
* [platformio/]: for PlatformIO
